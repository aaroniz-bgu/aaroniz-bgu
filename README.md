#### Heya!🙂
My name is Aaron Iziyaev, I'm a Software Engineering student from BGU 🐪.
I'm passionate about backend development, research and just messing around with my "barely-breathing" mac-mini.

Currently have 2 private projects in the making along-side with a paper about a certain problem on graphs.
One is a full-stack drive-cloud service which uses an iteresting conscept (to say the least).
